    <h1>Blog For My Invisible Dog</h1>
    <p>I haven't had many pets in my life. In fact, I've only had two in my youth. Their names were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zinna (she was a stray tabby cat we took in one day)</li>
        <li>Sam (he was a gray colored canary I got for Christmas one year. He died)</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>NO PETS</h2>
      <p>Since my wife and I have been married, we haven't had any pets. This is mainly due my acquired cat allergy and her double allergy to cats and dogs. So, we decided to get the most hypoallergenic pet available.</p>

      <p>Meet Lewis, the invisible dog!</p>
